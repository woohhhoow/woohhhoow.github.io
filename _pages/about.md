I am currently pursuing a degree in Landscape Architecture at the Politecnico di Milano, with a longstanding focus on the interplay between **site, imagery, and narrative**. Through my studies and practice, I have developed a personal observational approach: starting from natural elements like **topography, vegetation, and water systems**, I integrate **local culture, historical remnants, and social structures** to understand how a site is shaped over time and how it continues to influence future ways of living.

My design interests extend beyond traditional landscape boundaries. Instead, I often treat **photography** as an alternative form of “rapid site research,” using the lens to document information like **light, scale, materials, boundaries, noise, and human movement patterns**. For me, images serve both to capture and filter, helping me identify core clues within complex realities. In recent years, I've also explored the **intersection of imagery, GIS data, and AI tools**, aiming to extend technology as a means to comprehend environments and generate narratives.

In my projects, I pay particular attention to overlooked places: **abandoned railways, urban crevices, forgotten vacant lots, marginalized water bodies, fragmented yet valuable ecological corridors**. These sites often possess a raw, unresolved vitality and freedom. Through design, I aim to **reestablish order** for them rather than forcibly cover them up; to find a way that both **responds to reality** and **preserves space for future growth**. **Renewal, restoration, and activation** are the keywords I continually reflect upon.

For me, landscape is not merely “visible space” but a system shaped by the **interplay of natural and social forces**. It encompasses **the depth of time**, as well as people's **logic of use, lifestyles, and emotional experiences**. Therefore, I place particular emphasis on **narrative structure** in the design process, aiming to construct a clear logical thread through analysis and strategy—from **problem identification, system analysis, concept generation, to design expression**. Each step is traceable, while simultaneously presenting unique aesthetics and thought in the expression.

My studies in Milan provided extensive cross-cultural stimulation, enabling me to grasp the functioning of **European landscape systems** while contemplating the complexities of **land, rural areas, urban renewal, and ecological restoration** within the Chinese context. Moving forward, I aspire to return to China and continue exploring the relationship between **people, land, and infrastructure** through **eldercare, rural development, and urban public spaces**. My goal is to use design to address real-world challenges rather than merely pursue form.

Simultaneously, I am deeply fascinated by **interdisciplinary approaches**. **Photography, artificial intelligence, mapping techniques, narrative writing**—these seemingly disparate elements interconnect to form my lens for understanding the world. I believe design is not a singular skill but an ongoing capacity for **learning, research, analysis, and imagination**.

Whether in professional projects or personal creations, I strive for an **inner sense of honesty** in my work: **respecting the site, understanding reality, embracing uncertainty**, and spotting possibilities in the smallest details. Landscape architecture is a **slow profession**, and this deliberate pace allows me to listen more attentively to the stories of places and people, observe how cities breathe, and aspire to become a designer who truly **understands space and life**.
